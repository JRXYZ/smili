**Sparse Modeling Imaging Library for Interferometry**

This website is the documentation for `SMILI <https://github.com/astrosmili/smili>`_.
SMILI is a python-interfaced library for interferometric imaging using sparse
sampling techniques. SMILI is mainly designed for very long baseline interferometry,
and has been under the active development primarily for the
`Event Horizon Telescope <https://eventhorizontelescope.org>`_.

This documentation describes its basic usage with some example data sets.
However, SMILI has yet been actively and dynamically developed for many new topics
and challenges of the EHT. The documentation is not perfect and
sometimes outdated due to dynamical changes in the data structure.

Please contact to `Kazu Akiyama at MIT Haystack Observatory <http://kazuakiyama.github.io/>`_
if you have any questions about this library. You may contact with following
other core developers, too.
